This report explores the exciting world of Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) and how 
it can be used to detect license plate in cars. TinyML is operated on low-power 
microcontrollers boards with extensive hardware extraction. With the 
advancement in technology there is also an increase a criminal activities and people 
day by day are bypassing the cyber laws. This project is a simple implementation of 
object detection with many possibilities yet untouched. TinyML is a cool technology 
that lets small devices like Rasberry pi do smart things on their own, without needing 
big computers far away. This opens up lots of possibilities, like keeping an eye on the 
target vehicle or helping with identifying fake plates. 
We focused on using Ultralytics, to make a smart assistant called Yolo-v8. This 
assistant can zoom out number plates from the crowds. Instead of using a camera, we 
teach it using a set of pictures and videos we already have, making sure the computer 
knows where the no. plates are in each picture [1]. This shows how TinyML is versatile 
and can handle different kinds of data situations. 
The report guides you through the steps, starting with getting the dataset ready, 
teaching the model, and then putting it onto a smart edge board. The goal is to show 
how this tech can be useful for spotting vehicle number plates, with potential uses in 
tracking and assisting with any govt. uses. As we go through the steps, we highlight 
why it's cool to have machines making smart decisions right on the device, without 
always needing help from big computers somewhere else.
